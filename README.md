## About

Out of Light is a first-person horror game developed in Unity. The game follows a protagonist who must navigate through a dark, eerie house with only a flashlight and lighter to illuminate their path. Players must manage battery life, find keys, and uncover the mystery of what happened in this unsettling environment. This project was created as a two-week college assignment by Juwan Jouma and Joulian Alsuliman.

## Technologies

- **Unity**: Game engine used for development
- **C#**: Programming language for game logic
- **Post-Processing Stack**: For enhanced visual effects
- **Volumetric Lighting**: For realistic light beams and atmosphere
- **The Vegetation Engine**: For realistic foliage and environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2021.3 or later
- Basic knowledge of Unity interface

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Unity

## Game Mechanics

- **Flashlight Management**: Your flashlight has limited battery life. It will start flickering when the battery is low and eventually turn off. Find batteries to recharge it.
- **Item Interaction**: Pick up and use various items like keys to progress through the game.
- **Stamina System**: Running depletes your stamina. When it's low, you'll need to rest before sprinting again.
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Notes and the environment itself tell the story as you progress.
